# Hash Verificator Tool
This program (in french and english) is made to calculate the numeric signature (hash) of a file of your choice.

Many standard hash's algorithmes are available (MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA-256).

It's also able to check the integrity of your file by comparing the hash calculated with the original one that you can paste in this program.

If you want to compile this sources, note that the DLLs used in this project are the same than in my previous project "ClassGenerator". You can download this files located in the "dll" and "platforms" directories of this GitHub repository :  https://github.com/Seb2lyon/ClassGenerator.

You can also download for free the executable installer for Windows : https://sourceforge.net/projects/hash-verificator-tool/

Don't hesitate to send me comment and help me to improve this project. 

Be safe ;-)
