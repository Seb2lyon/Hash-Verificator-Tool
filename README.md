# Hash Verificator Tool
This program (in french and english) will calculate the numeric signature (hash) of a file of your choice.

Many standard hash's algorithms available (MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA-256).

You will also be able to check the integrity of your file by comparing the hash calculated with the original one that you can paste in this program.

I'm still working on this project...

To be continued ;-)
